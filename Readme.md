## Project Overview
This To-Do application is designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. Built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the app provides the following core features:

### Key Features:
1. *Add Tasks*: Users can create new tasks by providing a title and description, with the option to set a deadline.
2. *Edit Tasks*: Users can update or modify the details of existing tasks.
3. *Delete Tasks*: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
4. *Set Deadlines*: Users can set deadlines for tasks to manage priorities.
5. *Task List*: The main interface displays all tasks with details.
6. *Mark Tasks as Complete*: Users can mark tasks as completed.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- *Git*
- *Node.js* (version >= 14.x)
- *MongoDB* (local database or remote)
- *npm* or *yarn*

## Installation
1. *Clone the repository:*
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Group_BSE24-ToDoApp.git
    

2. *Navigate to the project directory:*
    bash
    cd C:\ Group_BSE24-ToDoApp
    

3. *Install server-side (Node.js) dependencies:*
    bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    

4. *Install client-side (React.js) dependencies:*
    bash

    cd backend
    npm start
    

- *Start the frontend (React.js) development server:*

The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (client) and http://localhost:5000 (server).

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Branching Strategy
- The main branch is protected and should always contain the latest stable version.
- Feature development happens on individual branches:
    bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    
- Once a feature is complete, push your branch and open a pull request for review.

### Commit Messages
- Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages:
    
    feat: [short description] – for new features
    fix: [short description] – for bug fixes
    refactor: [short description] – for restructuring code
    

### Pull Requests
- Ensure your pull request is reviewed by at least one team member.
- Use the provided PR template and link related issues.
- Once approved, squash and merge changes into main.

## Contributing
Contributions from all team members are welcome. Ensure your changes align with project goals.
- Discuss major changes with the team before starting.
- Follow the project's style guidelines and document your code
