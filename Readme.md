## Collaboration Guidelines

### Branching Strategy
- The `main` branch is protected and should always have the latest stable version of the project.
- Feature development must happen on individual feature branches:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

- Once the feature is complete, push your branch and open a pull request.

### Commit Messages
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the work done. Follow this structure:
  ```
  feat: [description] – for adding a new feature
  fix: [description] – for fixing a bug
  refactor: [description] – for code restructuring
  ```

### Pull Requests
- Make sure all pull requests are properly reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
- Follow the PR template, if provided, and make sure to link any relevant issues.
- Once approved, squash and merge your changes into the `main` branch.



## Contributing
We encourage collaboration and contributions from all team members. Please ensure that any contributions align with the project's overall goals and standards.

- Before starting work on any major changes, please discuss them with the team.
- Make sure your code follows the project’s style guidelines and is well-documented.
